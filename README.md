## Algorithm & Data Structures

> Yay! Its the first day of 2018.

I have compiled together a comprehensive list of standard Algorithm and Data Structures below. As a new year resolution, my goal will be to implement all of these using python. Furthermore, as I go deeper down the list, I will be adding links to article and video resources, that I used to understand the concepts. 

### Data Structures (basic)

- Stacks
- Queues
- Linked Lists
- Binary Search Tree
- Heap / Priority Queue / Binary Heap

### Data Structures (advanced)

- Trie
- Segment trees
- Fenwick tree or Binary indexed tree(BIT)
- Disjoint data structures

### Sorting Algorithms

- Selection
- Insertion
- Heapsort
- Quicksort
- Merge sort

### Graph Algorithms

- Breadth first search (BFS)
- Depth first search(DFS)
- Strongly connected components (SCC)
- Minimum spanning tree(MST)
- Topological sort

### Search Techniques

- Linear search

- Hash Table
- Meet in the middle
- Interpolation Search

### Dynamic programming
